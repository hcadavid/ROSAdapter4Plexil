# Adapter for integrating PLEXIL plans with ROS

Part of the project [Reliable Control Architecture with PLEXIL and ROS for Autonomous Wheeled Robots](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Camilo-Rocha-2/publication/319138847_Reliable_Control_Architecture_with_PLEXIL_and_ROS_for_Autonomous_Wheeled_Robots/links/59a5c1d00f7e9b41b786cd53/Reliable-Control-Architecture-with-PLEXIL-and-ROS-for-Autonomous-Wheeled-Robots.pdf)

This adapter allows controlling a ROS (Robot Operating System) compliant using PLEXIL, a NASA open-source language and interpreter for defining and executing plans for automation. 

The following shows a ROS-compliant (simulated in Gazebo) rover executing the pure-pursuit control algorithm defined in PLEXIL.
